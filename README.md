# NLP-on-Depression-Detection

 In this project, we explored how
effective it is to detect depressed users based on their
social account activities. We experimented with NLP
methods, including BERT and LIWC, and supervised
classification models, including kNN, SVM, LR, and
Neural Network, to identify labeled depressed users
from a Twitter database by their posts. To test if
BERT captures the language patterns of depressed
people and if the classification model can be applied
to general social network data, we analyzed the data
mislabeled by the models and searched for distinct
patterns. We further applied more user profile features
to the classification and checked which features helped
increase the accuracy of the classification.
